# s18_InteractiveCapstone
This capstone is an interactive web based experience aimed at shocking the user into a more conscious and sustainable diet. Through a simulation style game, users will be informed of the consequences and impacts of their daily diet choices. By presenting the game as a series of good and bad choices, the game teaches that one good action isn’t enough to make a positive change, but that by avoiding bad choices an individual can make a change. After each scenario, users will be provided with information depending on their selection. “Winning” and “Loosing” the game will be determined by the theme of deterioration, with poor choices being reflected in the overall deterioration of the web page. As in real life, there is no real reward for wining the game. But the game can be lost, and in losing the game (or managing to finish the game), the page will prompt the player to share the game with others, to spread awareness.
