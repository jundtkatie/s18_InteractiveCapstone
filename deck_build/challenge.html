The manufacturing of cheese includes the addition of large amounts of salt, and results in a highly processed product. As an animal product, it is subject to bioaccumulation, and is naturally high in saturated fats, cholesterol, and hormones. Cow’s milk is a hormonal fluid, designed by nature to turn a calf into a full grown cow. When you chose to consumer milk or other dairy products, you are also consuming the hormones, antibiotics, and other environmental toxins that the cow was subjected to while producing that product.

Not only do casomorphins have a similar, drug-like, effect as opioids, but they may play a role in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and autism.
