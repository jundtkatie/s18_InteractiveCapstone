    The production of meat and other animal products places a heavy burden on the environment<span class="hover15"><sup>15</sup></span>

      <div id="stuff15">Raising animals for food produces more greenhouse gases than the entire transportation sector.</div>

    - from crops and water<span class="hover16"><sup>16</sup></span>

    making the switch to veganism one of the easiest, most enjoyable and most effective ways to reduce our impact on the environment.<span class="hover24"><sup>24</sup></span>

      <div id="stuff24">A person who follows a vegan diet produces the equivalent of 50% less carbon dioxide, uses 1/11th oil, 1/13th water, and 1/18th land compared to a meat-lover for their food.</div>
  </div>

    <div id="people">Just like veganism is the sustainable option when it comes to looking after our planet, plant-based living is also a more sustainable way of feeding the human family. A plant-based diet requires only one third of the land needed to support a meat and dairy diet.<span class="hover25"><sup>25</sup></span>

    With rising global food and water insecurity due to a myriad of environmental and socio-economic problems, there's never been a better time to adopt a more sustainable way of living. Avoiding animal products is not just one of the simplest ways an individual can reduce the strain on food as well as other resources, it's the simplest way to take a stand against inefficient food systems<span class="hover26"><sup>26</sup></span> 

      <div id="stuff26">Testing shows 88% of pork chops, 90% of ground beef, and 95% of chicken breasts sampled were contaminated with fecal bacteria.</div>

    which disproportionately affects the poorest people all over the world.<span class="hover27"><sup>27</sup></span>

      <div id="stuff27">Each day, a person who eats a vegan diet saves 1,100 gallons of water, 45 pounds of grain, 30 sq ft of forested land, 20 lbs CO2 equivalent, and one animal’s life.</div>
    </div>

    <div id="vegetarian">The suffering caused by the dairy<span class="hover28"><sup>28</sup></span> 

      <div id="stuff28">The dairy industry is the veal industry. When a calf is born, they are removed from their mother within a day or two to make the mother’s milk available for human collection and consumption. Cows are wary of humans and try to help one another protect their calves from the farmers. Female calves are taken while still wet from birth and placed in a solitary crate. These young calves are raised for veal or put in the milk production system. Both outcomes involve lives of exploitation, loneliness, and a premature death.</div>

    and egg<span class="hover29"><sup>29</sup></span> 

      <div id="stuff29">Egg production farms, or industrial hen houses, subjects females to live their entire lives in small, wire ‘battery’ cages that often hold 5-10 chickens. The average hen is given less than an 8 ½ x 11-inch encaged area to live in her entire life. </div>

    industry is possibly less well publicized than the plight of factory farmed animals.<span class="hover30"><sup>30</sup></span>

      <div id="stuff30">Pigs in factory farms are wrapped in darkness. Pigs are fully aware of their own existence and are even more intelligent than dogs. On factory farms, pigs do not experience fresh air until the last day of their lives, when they are transported to slaughter.</div>

    <span class="hover31"><sup>31</sup></span>

      <div id="stuff31">Chickens raised for meat are called broilers, and live in a crowded shed where the ammonia from their own waste irritated and burns their eyes, throats, and skin. It is not uncommon for chickens to be beaten, stabbed, and impaled by workers while being gathered for slaughter. These workers spray the chickens with smoke to subdue them.</div>

    <span class="hover32"><sup>32</sup></span>

      <div id="stuff32">Beef Cattle Factory Farms feed cattle a grain diet that is unnatural and hard on their digestive system, causing chronic illness and bacteria complications. It is common for young calves to develop acute throat irritation resulting from repeated crying for their mothers.</div>

    products necessitates the death of countless male calves that are of no use to the dairy farmer, as well as the premature death of cows slaughtered when their milk production decreases. <br>

    Similarly, in the egg industry, even ‘ethical’ or ‘free range’<span class="hover33"><sup>33</sup></span> 

      <div id="stuff33">Even ‘free-range’ chickens are often kept inside massive crowded sheds without ever going outside.</div>

    eggs involve the killing of the ‘unnecessary’ male chicks when just a day old. Hens are debeaked and declawed at a young age to prevent them from harming themselves and others out of the stress they will experience in their lives.<span class="hover34"><sup>34</sup></span>

      <div id="stuff34">The cages cause bruises and abrasions,  and because the cages are stacked on top of one another, and the waste of the chickens continuously falls on the chickens below. </div>
  </div>

    <div id="ethicalmeat">It’s tempting to want to believe that the meat we eat is ethical, that our ‘food animals’ have lived full, <span class="hoverE">happy lives</span>
