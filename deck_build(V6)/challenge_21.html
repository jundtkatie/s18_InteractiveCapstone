  <div id="scenario1" data-slide="1" class="slide show">
    <div class="wdywtd">My friends and family won’t like it if I go vegan</div>
	  <h2 class="example">Social pressure can be one of the hardest aspects of going vegan for many people.</h2>

	  <h3><a class="link choice1">
		It’s my friends that I’m worried about
	  </a></h3>
	  <h3><a class="link choice2">
		My family will be hardest for me
	  </a></h3>
	  <!-- <a class="link quit" href="index.html" data-link="#scenario1_result3">
		I can’t do this!
	  </a> -->
	</div>


	  <div class="result1">People’s friends have no control over the actions or decisions that they make in their life and at no point should friends stop anyone from following their morals and becoming vegan. However, it is important to also note that peer pressure is an incredibly difficult thing to deal with, especially when someone feels like they are being mocked or laughed at. What’s so important to realize though is nobody should ever let the opinions of others stop them from following a way of life that is morally right. 
<br><br>
What makes the friends situation particularly hard is that so many social interactions either revolve around food or at least involve food and as such, people don’t want to isolate themselves from their friends by avoiding situations that involve food. 
<br><br>
Fortunately, this situation is getting easier all the time as more and more places are introducing vegan options and vegan menus and the concept of veganism is becoming increasingly normalized. There is also a huge community of vegans both online and offline and if someone is struggling with their non-vegan friends or wants to go vegan but is worried about their friends, encourage them to join online vegan groups or to go to vegan meet ups where they can meet likeminded people. 
<br><br>
Also, Remember to never forget that the pain and suffering the animals go through, the damage animal products do to their health and the environmental crisis we are currently facing are all far too important to be dismissed because of unreceptive friends and family. 
<br><br>
But most importantly, there is a huge, supportive community that is always available to offer support, advice and help so if you feel isolated or alone because your friends and family are making you feel uncomfortable, you can always talk to the community because being vegan means they are never truly on their own.

    </div>


	  <div class="result2">If the person doesn’t live at home anymore then of course their family questioning their desire to become vegan shouldn’t stop them from becoming vegan. However, if the person still lives at home it can make going vegan a lot more difficult than it would be otherwise. 
<br><br>
The hardest part of trying to go vegan around your family is not necessarily their judgments, it’s the fact that you have to watch the people you love actively committing immoral acts in front of you whilst also poisoning their bodies at the same time. 
<br><br>
If you still live at home, try and show your family why it is you want to go vegan, perhaps show your family documentaries or YouTube videos. You could also cook for your family in order to show them that vegan food is delicious, affordable, accessible and healthy. 
<br><br>
A lot of the time parents and family just don’t understand veganism or why someone would want to go vegan, so it’s important that anyone who wants to go vegan is knowledgeable in why they want to go vegan so that they can properly talk to their family about it. 
<br><br>
Also, remember to never forget that the pain and suffering the animals go through, the damage animal products do to their health and the environmental crisis we are currently facing are all far too important to be dismissed because of unreceptive friends and family. 
<br><br>
But most importantly, there is a huge, supportive community that is always available to offer support, advice and help so if you feel isolated or alone because your friends and family are making you feel uncomfortable, you can always talk to the community because being vegan means they are never truly on their own.
