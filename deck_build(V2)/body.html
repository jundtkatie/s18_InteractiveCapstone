    <h2 id="vegetarian">The suffering caused by the dairy<span class="hoverspan"><sup>28</sup></span> 

      <div class="callout" id="stuff28">The dairy industry is the veal industry. When a calf is born, they are removed from their mother within a day or two to make the mother’s milk available for human collection and consumption. Cows are wary of humans and try to help one another protect their calves from the farmers. Female calves are taken while still wet from birth and placed in a solitary crate. These young calves are raised for veal or put in the milk production system. Both outcomes involve lives of exploitation, loneliness, and a premature death.</div>

    and egg<span class="hoverspan"><sup>29</sup></span> 

      <div class="callout" id="stuff29">Egg production farms, or industrial hen houses, subjects females to live their entire lives in small, wire ‘battery’ cages that often hold 5-10 chickens. The average hen is given less than an 8 ½ x 11-inch encaged area to live in her entire life. </div>

    industry is possibly less well publicized than the plight of factory farmed animals.<span class="hoverspan"><sup>30</sup></span>

      <div class="callout" id="stuff30">Pigs in factory farms are wrapped in darkness. Pigs are fully aware of their own existence and are even more intelligent than dogs. On factory farms, pigs do not experience fresh air until the last day of their lives, when they are transported to slaughter.</div>

    <span class="hoverspan"><sup>31</sup></span>

      <div class="callout" id="stuff31">Chickens raised for meat are called broilers, and live in a crowded shed where the ammonia from their own waste irritated and burns their eyes, throats, and skin. It is not uncommon for chickens to be beaten, stabbed, and impaled by workers while being gathered for slaughter. These workers spray the chickens with smoke to subdue them.</div>

    <span class="hoverspan"><sup>32</sup></span>

      <div class="callout" id="stuff32">Beef Cattle Factory Farms feed cattle a grain diet that is unnatural and hard on their digestive system, causing chronic illness and bacteria complications. It is common for young calves to develop acute throat irritation resulting from repeated crying for their mothers.</div>

    <br>The production of <span class="hoverD">dairy</span>

    products necessitates the death of countless male calves that are of no use to the dairy farmer, as well as the premature death of cows slaughtered when their milk production decreases. <br>

    Similarly, in the egg industry, even ‘ethical’ or ‘free range’<span class="hoverspan"><sup>33</sup></span> 

      <div class="callout" id="stuff33">Even ‘free-range’ chickens are often kept inside massive crowded sheds without ever going outside.</div>

    eggs involve the killing of the ‘unnecessary’ male chicks when just a day old. Hens are debeaked and declawed at a young age to prevent them from harming themselves and others out of the stress they will experience in their lives.<span class="hoverspan"><sup>34</sup></span>

      <div class="callout" id="stuff34">The cages cause bruises and abrasions,  and because the cages are stacked on top of one another, and the waste of the chickens continuously falls on the chickens below. </div>
