    <div class="questions1" onclick="whatdoesitmean()">WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE VEGAN?</div>
    <div id="whatdoesitmean">
            <h3>Veganism represents a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, other animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of humans, other animals and the environment.</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="questions2" onclick="animals()">FOR THE ANIMALS</div>
    <div id="animals">
            <h3>Preventing the exploitation of animals is not the only reason for becoming vegan, but for many it remains the key factor in their decision to go vegan and stay vegan. Having emotional attachments with animals may form part of that reason, while many believe that all sentient creatures have a right to life and freedom. Specifics aside, avoiding animal products is one of the most obvious ways you can take a stand against animal cruelty and animal exploitation everywhere.</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="questions3" onclick="health()">FOR YOUR HEALTH</div>
    <div id="health">
            <h3>More and more people are turning to a vegan diet for the health benefits: increased energy, younger looking skin and eternal youth are just some of the claims from enthusiastic plant eaters. Well, eternal youth might be a bit optimistic, but there are certainly many scientifically proven benefits to vegan living when compared to the average western diet.
            Well-planned plant-based diets are rich in protein, iron, calcium and other essential vitamins and minerals. The plant-based sources of these nutrients tend to be low in saturated fat, high in fiber and packed with antioxidants, helping mitigate some of the modern world's biggest health issues like obesity, heart disease, diabetes and cancer. </h3>
    </div>

     <div class="questions4" onclick="earth()">FOR THE ENVIRONMENT</div>
    <div id="health">
            <h3>From recycling our household rubbish to cycling to work, we're all aware of ways to live a greener life. One of the most effective things an individual can do to lower their carbon footprint is to avoid all animal products. This goes way beyond the problem of cow flatulence!
            The production of meat and other animal products places a heavy burden on the environment - from crops and water required to feed the animals, to the transport and other processes involved from farm to fork. The vast amount of grain feed required for meat production is a significant contributor to deforestation, habitat loss and species extinction. In Brazil alone, the equivalent of 5.6 million acres of land is used to grow soya beans for animals in Europe. This land contributes to developing world malnutrition by driving impoverished populations to grow cash crops for animal feed, rather than food for themselves. On the other hand, considerably lower quantities of crops and water are required to sustain a vegan diet, making the switch to veganism one of the easiest, most enjoyable and most effective ways to reduce our impact on the environment.

    <div class="questions5" onclick="people()">FOR PEOPLE</div>
    <div id="people">
            <h3>Just like veganism is the sustainable option when it comes to looking after our planet, plant-based living is also a more sustainable way of feeding the human family. A plant-based diet requires only one third of the land needed to support a meat and dairy diet. With rising global food and water insecurity due to a myriad of environmental and socio-economic problems, there's never been a better time to adopt a more sustainable way of living. Avoiding animal products is not just one of the simplest ways an individual can reduce the strain on food as well as other resources, it's the simplest way to take a stand against inefficient food systems which disproportionately affects the poorest people all over the world.

    <div class="questions6" onclick="vegetarian()">WHY VEGETARIAN ISN'T ENOUGH</div>
    <div id="vegetarian">
            <h3>The suffering caused by the dairy and egg industry is possibly less well publicised than the plight of factory farmed animals. The production of dairy products necessitates the death of countless male calves that are of no use to the dairy farmer, as well as the premature death of cows slaughtered when their milk production decreases. Similarly, in the egg industry, even 'ethical' or 'free range' eggs involve the killing of the 'unnecessary' male chicks when just a day old. 
            </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="questions7" onclick="ethicalmeat()">"ETHICAL MEAT"</div>
    <div id="ethicalmeat">
            <h3>It's tempting to want to believe that the meat we eat is ethical, that our 'food animals' have lived full, happy lives and that they have experienced no pain or fear at the slaughterhouse. Yet the sad truth is that all living creatures (even those labelled 'free range' or 'organic') fear death, just as we do. No matter how they are treated when alive, they all experience the same fear when it comes to slaughter.
            </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="questions8" onclick="factoryfarms()">FACTORY FARMS</div>
    <div id="factoryfarms">
            <h3>Factory farms are dens of profound animal abuse created to maximize corporate profits at the expense of the environment, rural communities, and human health. The animals on factory farms are bred to grow unnaturally large and fast. They are fed unhealthy amounts of antibiotics for the purpose of maximizing meat, egg, and milk production. The animal’s bodies cannot support this unnatural growth, which often results in painful conditions and deformities. The extreme confinement and the unsanitary conditions on factory farms require the use of additional antibiotics to inhibit the spread of disease, which is commonplace.
                Pigs in factory farms are wrapped in darkness. Pigs are fully aware of their own existence and are even more intelligent than dogs. On factory farms, pigs do not experience fresh air until the last day of their lives, when they are transported to slaughter.

                The dairy industry is the veal industry. When a calf is born, they are removed from their mother within a day or two to make the mother’s milk available for human collection and consumption. Cows are wary of humans and try to help one another protect their calves from the farmers. Female calves are taken while still wet from birth and placed in a solitary crate. These young calves are raised for veal or put in the milk production system. Both outcomes involve lives of exploitation, loneliness, and a premature death.

                Egg production farms, or industrial hen houses, kill males the day they are born. Females live their entire lives in small, wire ‘battery’ cages that often hold 5-10 chickens. The average hen is given less than an 8 ½ x 11-inch encaged area to live in her entire life. Hens are debeaked and declawed at a young age to prevent them from harming themselves and others out of the stress they will experience in their lives. The cages cause bruises and abrasions,  and because the cages are stacked on top of one another, and the waste of the chickens continuously falls on the chickens below. Even ‘free-range’ chickens are often kept inside massive crowded sheds without ever going outside.

                Chickens raised for meat are called broilers, and live in a crowded shed where the ammonia from their own waste irritated and burns their eyes, throats, and skin. It is not uncommon for chickens to be beaten, stabbed, and impaled by workers while being gathered for slaughter. These workers spray the chickens with smoke to subdue them.

                Beef Cattle Factory Farms feed cattle a grain diet that is unnatural and hard on their digestive system, causing chronic illness and bacteria complications. It is common for young calves to develop acute throat irritation resulting from repeated crying for their mothers.
